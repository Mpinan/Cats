## Planning

First thought when planning the app was to build it in C#.
Due to time restrintions, I had finally decided to do it in React with little styling which is what I am currently learning apart from Express.js.
Since I thought it was going to take me longer, I also tried to do a comparison app between dogs and cats using both cat and dog API

## Running the app

- Clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
